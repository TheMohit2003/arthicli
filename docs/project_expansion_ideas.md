1. Advanced Arithmetic Operations
Implement More Operations: Add more complex arithmetic operations like modulus, exponentiation, or even trigonometric functions.
Support for Floating Point Numbers: Modify your calculator to handle floating-point numbers, not just integers.
2. Interactive Mode
REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop): Implement an interactive mode where the user can continuously enter operations and receive results, similar to a standard calculator.
3. Command-Line Interface Enhancement
Flag and Argument Parsing: Utilize packages like flag or third-party packages like cobra to parse command-line arguments more robustly.
Help and Usage Instructions: Provide detailed help messages and usage instructions for users.
4. Error Handling and Validation
Improved Error Handling: Enhance the way your program handles errors, especially for user input errors.
Input Validation: Add more rigorous checks for the inputs to prevent invalid operations or data types.
5. Unit Testing
Write Test Cases: Add unit tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected and to practice test-driven development.
Benchmarking: Implement benchmark tests for performance-critical functions.
6. Persistence
History of Operations: Save the history of operations and results to a file and provide an option to view the history.
Configuration Files: Allow users to set preferences or defaults via a configuration file.
7. Networking Features
API Calls: If relevant, add features that require network connectivity, like fetching data from an API to use in calculations.
8. GUI
Graphical User Interface: As a stretch goal, create a GUI for your application using a library like fyne or gioui.
9. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Ensure Compatibility: Make sure your application runs smoothly on different operating systems.
10. Packaging and Distribution
Executable Building: Create a build process that generates executables for different platforms.
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize your application for easy distribution and deployment.
11. Documentation
Code Documentation: Write comprehensive code documentation and comments.
User Documentation: Create user manuals or online documentation to help others understand how to use your tool.
12. Version Control and Collaboration
Git and GitHub: If not already doing so, use Git for version control and possibly host your project on GitHub.
Open Source Contributions: Consider making your project open source and encourage contributions from others.
13. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Automate Testing and Building: Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the testing and building of your application.
